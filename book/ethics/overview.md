# Ethics

This chapter discusses two ethical categories relevant to our project. Its goal is to identify potential ethical concerns and explain how we address them, either currently (for concrete issues) or prospectively (for anticipated challenges in future developments).

We begin in [Ethics Cathegory 1](./cathegory1.md "Cathegory 1") with an analysis of ethical considerations related to personal data, which are directly applicable to the current implementation of our tool. In [Ethics Cathegory 2](./cathegory2.md "Ethics Cathegory 2"), we explore the possible future integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the ethical risks it may introduce, such as fairness and transparency. Together, these sections aim to shed light on both the ethical issues we are presently facing and those we may need to address as the project evolves.
