# Preface

This report was written by a group of 2nd-year Computer Science and Engineering students at Delft University of Technology, for the course CSE2000 Software Project.

We created an editor for TeachBooks - interactive textbooks that consist of Markdown files and are hosted on Github pages. This editor was made for our client, the TeachBooks team, in an effort to make creating and editing interactive books more accessible for educators that do not have a background in programming.

For the motivation behind the project, the definition of the problem, and the outline of our solution, see Chapters 1, 2, and 3. For details on the technical implementation, see Chapters 4, 5, and 6. For ethical and future considerations, see Chapters 7 and 8.

We would like to thank our TA, Diego Becerra Merodio, for guidance throughout the project, and our two contacts from the TeachBooks team, Tom van Woudenberg and Robert Lanzafame, for their continued input and involvement.
