# Component Infrastructure

We adopted a component-based architecture to promote code organization and reusability. All UI elements are defined in their own file located in the components directory. Take the toolbar for example: It is built by combining multiple small components such as formatting buttons, dropdown menus, and separators. These are defined in toolbar\\\_components.tsx, while the overall structure and layout logic of the toolbar is handled in toolbar.tsx. This structure ensures that each element has a well-defined responsibility and can be reused or modified independently.&#x20;

This separation of concerns is also applied to functionality: command functions that modify the editor state (toolbar\\\_commands.ts) are kept separate from utility functions that query it (toolbar\\\_utils.ts). The foundation for this is a custom schema (index.ts) that specifies the document's structure and supported nodes.&#x20;

Editor functionality such as toggling formatting styles (e.g., bold, italic), changing fonts, or inserting lists is implemented through a set of command functions located in toolbar\\\_commands.ts. These functions encapsulate how the editor state is manipulated through ProseMirrorâ€™s API. Related utility functions used to check formatting states like active marks or text alignment are stored separately in toolbar\\\_utils.ts to avoid mixing concerns.
