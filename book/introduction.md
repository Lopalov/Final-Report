# Introduction

Interactive textbooks have emerged as powerful digital learning tools, enabling students to engage with embedded questions, visualizations, and other interactive elements that enhance comprehension and retention. However, creating and editing these textbooks remains a challenge for educators who lack technical skills. The TeachBooks team has developed a platform to make creation and collaboration easier, but the current workflow requires knowledge of Markdown and Git, creating a barrier for less technically-experienced users. This barrier limits participation in interactive textbook development to those with specialized skills, contradicting the inclusive mission statement of TeachBooks:

> “Our philosophy is to make it possible, practical and fun for all teaching teams, regardless of experience. Because while TeachBooks can be made by individuals, we’ve seen that a team of teachers and student assistants can make a TeachBook that’s more accessible, attractive, and more interactive than any one person could make alone.”
