## User Testing Responses

1.  **Response 1 (16-6-2025 13:07:22):**

    *   **How would you rate your overall experience with the editor?**

        *   4/5
    *   **How easy was it to edit a document?**

        *   5/5
    *   **Which features did you find most useful?**

        *   To be directly able to edit text and save to GitHub. Amazing! Everything seems to be autosaved, which is amazing! Maybe add some sore of excamation mark that it’s out of sync with GitHub?
    *   **Which features did you find confusing or difficult to use?**

        *   Adding tables also adds some blank lines clicking down in a table brings you to the cell on the right
    *   **Were the toolbar buttons’ functions clear?**

        *   After trying, yes.
    *   **Did you try using any keyboard shortcuts? Did they work as expected**

        *   Ctr+Z did not work, but others worked as expected.
    *   **Did you use the math equation editor? Did it work as expected?**

        *   Yes adding latex stuff works, but as soon as I double click the equation it disappears.
    *   **Did you try inserting images, or code? What kind of issues, if any, did you experience?**

        *   Yes Images are alligned to the left, but text is wrapped around it in the final book (not in the editor itself) The image resizer has a different size than the figure the first time it is initiated. When I opened the page again and tried to resize the figure it didn’t work. Uploading image would be a nice-to-have
    *   **What was your experience with the GitHub integration? Were there any difficulties?**

        *   It works! Doesn’t work if baseurl / github link is incorrect. Would it be possible to give a warning? It seems that when the urls are incorrect the content of the existing page doesn’t load. A warning would be useful. i didn’t test it any further than that. files that have already been committed still show up. Clicking another dropdown doesn’t close the GitHub dropdown, leading to overlapping dropdowns. If i open another tab I need to input my PAT again. When making simulatenous changes in the github interface the commits from github are overwritten, not combined as expected or no merge conflicts:\

        *   &#x20;I tested this on [https://​douden​.github​.io​/openlabook​/main](https://douden.github.io/openlabook/main), and found that on many pages advanced directives are not supported or even the editor did not show anything except a blank page.
    *   **Is there a feature you expected but didn’t find?**

        *   Not yet.
    *   **What would you have changed or improved about the editor?**

        *   Add an explicit button for “save & commit”.
    *   **Do you have any other comments or suggestions?**

        *   I noticed that some non-recognised roles are removed from the markdown and the original markdown is changed without the need for it. I would recommend at least keeping the code that cannot be parsed in the document and showing the code that cannot be parsed as code.
