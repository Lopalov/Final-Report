## Stakeholder Survey Responses

Survey respondersâ€™ contact information has been redacted.

1.  **Response 1:**

    *   **What is your role in education?**

        *   Teacher or curriculum developer
    *   **How experienced are you with creating or editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Very experienced
    *   **How often do you view, create, or edit Teachbooks?**

        *   Every day
    *   **If you have created or edited Teachbooks, which tools have you used and which obstacles have you encountered?**

        *   Just remembering syntax for things like admonitions always delays my writing. Also small bugs like malformed table of contents or config file entries are very difficult to troubleshoot. Having a tool to easily validate and/or produce correct code for these things would be helpful.
    *   **If a visual editor for Teachbooks already existed, what features would it need to have for you to consider using it?**

        *   Extremely easy to open up and search for specific things, then get plenty of examples and code snippets to copy/paste/insert into my own book source code.
    *   **What (other) features would you like to see to improve the experience of creating and editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Rendering of MyST in a reliable way would be great.
    *   **Would you like to test early versions of the editor to give feedback during development?**

        *   Yes, you can contact me for early test runs.
2.  **Response 2:**

    *   **What is your role in education?**

        *   Teacher or curriculum developer
    *   **How experienced are you with creating or editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Somewhat experienced
    *   **How often do you view, create, or edit Teachbooks?**

        *   At least once per week
    *   **If you have created or edited Teachbooks, which tools have you used and which obstacles have you encountered?**

        *   Awaiting Julia Programming language integration
    *   **If a visual editor for Teachbooks already existed, what features would it need to have for you to consider using it?**

        *   I prefer the text editor since it allows for a more comprehensive formatting.
    *   **What (other) features would you like to see to improve the experience of creating and editing Teachbooks?**

        *   *Not answered*
    *   **Would you like to test early versions of the editor to give feedback during development?**

        *   ** **Yes, you can contact me for early test runs.
3.  **Response 3:**

    *   **What is your role in education?**

        *   Teacher or curriculum developer
    *   **How experienced are you with creating or editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Very experienced
    *   **How often do you view, create, or edit Teachbooks?**

        *   Less than once per month
    *   **If you have created or edited Teachbooks, which tools have you used and which obstacles have you encountered?**

        *   I usually edit the files locally.
    *   **If a visual editor for Teachbooks already existed, what features would it need to have for you to consider using it?**

        *   A quick preview option would be nice. I can preview markdown files and notebooks locally, but no admonitions or interactive elements without building the book. If that limit can be pushed with a visual editor I would consider using it.
    *   **What (other) features would you like to see to improve the experience of creating and editing Teachbooks?**

        *   *Not answered*
    *   **Would you like to test early versions of the editor to give feedback during development?**

        *   No, I do not have the time to test and give feedback / I am not interested in testing.
4.  **Response 4:**

    *   **What is your role in education?**

        *   Teacher or curriculum developer
    *   **How experienced are you with creating or editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Somewhat experienced
    *   **How often do you view, create, or edit Teachbooks?**

        *   Never
    *   **If you have created or edited Teachbooks, which tools have you used and which obstacles have you encountered?**

        *   GitLab, Visual Studio Code, web browser (but all for the TUD OIT books).
    *   **If a visual editor for Teachbooks already existed, what features would it need to have for you to consider using it?**

        *   Easy setup of a project, creating (new) chapters, inserting graphics/video, inserting quizzes, text editing, commenting (for others to edit, not public, like Overleaf), drag\\\&drop of special components (such as the graphical ToC, 'cards' as clickable buttons), some form of syntax error detection.
    *   **What (other) features would you like to see to improve the experience of creating and editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Add more info on how this links to the Open Interactive Textbook initiative (e.g. steps involved in publishing). Also, why host on GitHub and not TUD GitLab (closed for outside contributions)?
    *   **Would you like to test early versions of the editor to give feedback during development?**

        *   No, I do not have the time to test and give feedback / I am not interested in testing.
5.  **Response 5:**

    *   **What is your role in education?**

        *   Teacher or curriculum developer
    *   **How experienced are you with creating or editing Teachbooks?**

        *   Somewhat experienced
    *   **How often do you view, create, or edit Teachbooks?**

        *   At least once per month
    *   **If you have created or edited Teachbooks, which tools have you used and which obstacles have you encountered?**

        *   VS Code. As a high school teacher (and TU Delft student) one of the things holding us back from implementing Teachbooks is the ease of use for less technical colleagues. They are not interested in learning git and VS Code can scare them off.
    *   **If a visual editor for Teachbooks already existed, what features would it need to have for you to consider using it?**

        *   WYSIWYG editor; version control; a clear tutorial; limited options by default, but the possibility to access all options of the book.
    *   **What (other) features would you like to see to improve the experience of creating and editing Teachbooks?**

        *   *Not answered*
    *   **Would you like to test early versions of the editor to give feedback during development?**

        *   Yes, you can contact me for early test runs.
