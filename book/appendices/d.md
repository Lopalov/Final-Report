## Stakeholder Survey Responses

Survey responders' contact information has been redacted.


| Response Time       | Role in Education           | Experience         | Frequency       | Tools & Obstacles | Desired Features | Other Features | Willing to Test? |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|
| 7-5-2025 13:06:05    | Teacher or curriculum developer | Very experienced  | Every day        | Just remembering syntax for things like admonitions always delays my writing. Also small bugs like malformed table of contents or config file entries are very difficult to troubleshoot. Having a tool to easily validate and/or produce correct code for these things would be helpful. | Extremely easy to open up and search for specific things, then get plenty of examples and code snippets to copy/paste/insert into my own book source code. | Rendering of MyST in a reliable way would be great. | Yes, you can contact me for early test runs. |
| 7-5-2025 14:46:28    | Teacher or curriculum developer | Somewhat experienced | At least once per week | Awaiting Julia Programming language integration |  I prefer the text editor since it allows for a more comprehensive formatting. | *Not answered* | Yes, you can contact me for early test runs. |
| 9-5-2025 11:21:02    | Teacher or curriculum developer | Very experienced  | Less than once per month | I usually edit the files locally. | A quick preview option would be nice. I can preview markdown files and notebooks locally, but no admonitions or interactive elements without building the book. If that limit can be pushed with a visual editor I would consider using it. | *Not answered* | No, I do not have the time to test and give feedback / I am not interested in testing. |
| 9-5-2025 16:07:36    | Teacher or curriculum developer | Somewhat experienced | Never | GitLab, Visual Studio Code, web browser (but all for the TUD OIT books). | Easy setup of a project, creating (new) chapters, inserting graphics/video, inserting quizzes, text editing, commenting (for others to edit, not public, like Overleaf), drag\&drop of special components (such as the graphical ToC, 'cards' as clickable buttons), some form of syntax error detection. | Add more info on how this links to the Open Interactive Textbook initiative (e.g. steps involved in publishing). Also, why host on GitHub and not TUD GitLab (closed for outside contributions)? | No, I do not have the time to test and give feedback / I am not interested in testing. |
| 18-5-2025 01:09:03   | Teacher or curriculum developer | Somewhat experienced | At least once per month | VS Code. As a high school teacher (and TU Delft student) one of the things holding us back from implementing Teachbooks is the ease of use for less technical colleagues. They are not interested in learning git and VS Code can scare them off. | WYSIWYG editor; version control; a clear tutorial; limited options by default, but the possibility to access all options of the book. | *Not answered* | Yes, you can contact me for early test runs. |
