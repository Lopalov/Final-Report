# Research

This chapter covers the research that was done at the start of the study to determine the technologies that would be used to aid implementing the editor. First section \ref{sec:feasibility} will highlight the research that was done to determine the feasibility of the project. Then section \ref{sec:risk} will cover the risks to the project that were considered, and their proposed mitigation. The subsequent sections detail our technical investigations: Section~\ref{sec:converting} covers Markdown/MyST conversion, Section~\ref{sec:sphinx} explores Sphinx integration approaches, Section\` justifies our editor interface design, and Section~\ref{sec:github} documents GitHub integration research.
