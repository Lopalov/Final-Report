# Research

This chapter covers the research that was done to determine the technologies and frameworks that would be used to aid implementing the editor. First, in [Converting to and from Markdown](./markdown_conversion.md) we will talk about the research that went into discovering how to change to and from markdown, then in [Sphinx Extension](,/sphinx.md) we explore Sphinx integration approaches, in Section [Toolbar and Editor](./toolbar.md) we talk about the research that we did on toolbar and editor technologies. Lastly, in Section [Github Integration](./github.md) we talk about what we learned about GitHub integration.
