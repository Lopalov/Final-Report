# Development

In this chapter, we discuss the development methodology and   organization of our team, as well as the testing methods we have set up. The goal is to provide information about the decisions we have made regarding the development process.

We first discuss the development methodology of our team in Section ~\ref{sec:development\_methodology}, after which, we briefly explain the meeting structure in Section ~\ref{sec:meetings}.  An overview of our communication methods follows in Section ~\ref{sec:communication} and then we will give a brief overview of the task attribution methods in Section ~\ref{sec:task\_attribution}.  We will finish this chapter by taking a look at the Testing frameworks and methods we have employed in Section \ref{sec:testing}.
