# Development

In this chapter, we discuss the development methodology and   organization of our team, as well as the testing methods we have set up. The goal is to provide information about the decisions we have made regarding the development process.

We first discuss the [development methodology](./methodology.md), where we talk about our meeting structure, communication methods and task attribution. We will finish this chapter by taking a look at the [Testing](./testing.md) frameworks and methods we have employed.
