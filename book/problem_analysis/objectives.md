# Objectives

Our primary objective, based on the specifications of our client, was to develop a browser-based text editor that abstracts the complexities of the described workflow.

Specifically, the editor should:

*   Simplify the creation and editing of TeachBooks as they currently exist - Jupyterbooks created using MySTMD.
*   Allow users to edit and preview content in a user-friendly interface.
*   Commit changes to the underlying GitHub repository without requiring knowledge of Git commands.
*   Allow users to contribute to git repositories through intuitive user-interface elements.
*   Integrate securely with GitHub.
*   Operate entirely within the browser.
*   Be open source, so that it can be further developed and maintained by other parties.

These requirements solve the problems described before by lowering the barrier of entry for contributing to TeachBooks, without requiring technical know-how to set up the editor.
