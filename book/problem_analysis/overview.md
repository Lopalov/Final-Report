# Problem Analysis

Creating and editing TeachBooks can be a challenge for educators who lack knowledge of GitHub, Markdown syntax, or working with the command line. This limits participation and distracts educators from the primary goal of creating educational content. This makes it clear that our primary stakeholders, besides our client, are those educators who desire a more accessible and efficient way to contribute.
