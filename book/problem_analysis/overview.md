# Problem Analysis

Creating and editing TeachBooks can be a challenge for educators who lack knowledge of GitHub, Markdown syntax, or working with the command line. This limits participation and distracts educators from the primary goal of creating educational content. This makes it clear that our primary stakeholders, besides our client, are those educators who desire a more accessible and efficient way to contribute.

This chapter begins with an overview of the core problem our project addresses in [Problem Statement](./context.md). We then define the specific objectives of the editor and the outcomes we aim to achieve ([Objectives](./objectives.md)), followed by a detailed explanation of the scope and boundaries of the project ([Scope of the Problem](./scope.md)). [Feasobility Study](./feasability.md) presents a feasibility study that explores the technical challenges and opportunities. Finally, [Risk Analysis](./risk.md) identifies potential risks and how they may affect the sustainability of the project.
