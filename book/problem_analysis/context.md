# Problem Statement

The standard workflow for TeachBooks involves using GitHub to manage content repositories, writing in Markdown syntax, building Jupyter notebooks, and employing GitHub Actions to build and deploy the book online. While this setup is powerful, it requires a level of technical proficiency that many educators may not possess. The need for a more accessible editing interface is evident to broaden participation and ease content management.

Creating or updating a TeachBook typically involves:

*   Writing content in MyST-flavored Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks.
*   Managing repository structure using Git and GitHub.
*   Triggering automated build pipelines (e.g., via GitHub Actions) to publish the content online.

For many educators, especially those outside of technical fields, this process can be intimidating and error-prone. Even minor edits, such as correcting a typo or updating an exercise, require a sequence of unfamiliar operations involving version control, branching, and pull requests.
