# Non-Functional Requirements

This project is committed to open-source development, and the codebase will be released under a permissive license, with accompanying documentation such as a README and CONTRIBUTING files to guide contributors. Maintainability is a top priority, with modular code organization and well-documented APIs to facilitate future updates â€” especially if the platform migrates to Jupyter Book 2.x or expands Git integration options.

Performance is another concern. The editor must load and respond promptly, targeting sub-three-second render times for standard pages. Security measures include careful handling of GitHub tokens and minimizing permission scopes during authentication to maintain user trust.
