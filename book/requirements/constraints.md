# Constraints

Several project constraints shape the scope of this release. Compatibility with Jupyter Book 1.x is mandatory, as is a GitHub-centered editing and workflow experience. The tool must fully comply with existing Sphinx and Jupyter Book file structures, naming conventions, and syntax to ensure a seamless user experience.
