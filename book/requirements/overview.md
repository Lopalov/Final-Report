# Requirements

This chapter defines the technical specifications and constraints of our project. Its primary purpose is to establish clear guidelines for implementation while addressing the core question: *What functionality must our editor provide to effectively serve the users in creating interactive textbooks?*

We begin by describing how the requirements were collaboratively created and refined through early discussions with the client and continuous feedback from the teaching staff ([see Creation and Refinement](./creation.md)). To clearly define priorities, we organize the finalized requirements using the MoSCoW prioritization method—categorizing them as *Must*, *Should*, *Could*, or *Won’t*—to distinguish essential features from enhancements and explicitly excluded items (The requirements are ordered and summarized in the appendix). [Functional Requirements](./functional.md) outlines the functional requirements, covering core editor capabilities, [Non-Functional Requirements](./non-functional.md) focuses on non-functional requirements such as maintainability, performance, and security. [Constraints](constraints.md) details the technical constraints and boundaries that shaped the scope of the implementation. Lastly, [Implementation Status](status.md) reflects on where we currently are on the road-map for implementing the requirements. This comprehensive specification serves both as a development guide and a shared agreement with stakeholders to validate outcomes. The requirements are summarized in [Appendix A](../appendices/a.md), which includes one table listing all requirements using the MoSCoW method, and another table showing which requirements have been completed and which have not.
