# Requirements

This chapter defines the technical specifications and constraints of our project. Its primary purpose is to establish clear guidelines for implementation while addressing the core question: *What functionality must our editor provide to effectively serve the users in creating interactive textbooks?*

We begin by describing how the requirements were collaboratively created and refined through early discussions with the client and continuous feedback from the teaching staff (Section~\ref{sec:refinement}). To clearly define priorities, we organize the finalized requirements using the MoSCoW prioritization method—categorizing them as \textit{Must}, \textit{Should}, \textit{Could}, or \textit{Won’t}—to distinguish essential features from enhancements and explicitly excluded items (The requirements are ordered and summarized in the appendix). Section~\ref{sec:functional} outlines the functional requirements, covering core editor capabilities, Section~\ref{sec:non-functional} focuses on non-functional requirements such as maintainability, performance, and security. Section~\ref{sec:constraints} details the technical constraints and boundaries that shaped the scope of the implementation. Lastly, Section~\ref{sec:status} reflects on where we currently are on the road-map for implementing the requirements. This comprehensive specification serves both as a development guide and a shared agreement with stakeholders to validate outcomes. The requirements are summarized in Section~\ref{sec:requirements\_summary} of the Appendix, which includes one table listing all requirements using the MoSCoW method, and another table showing which requirements have been completed and which have not.
