# Implementation Status

As of the current release, all *Must Have* requirements have been implemented, though some require additional testing and polishing. One of the core functionalities - GitHub assistance pop-ups have been implemented, however more content for them can be made.

However, most *Should Have* and lower-priority requirements (e.g. advanced accessibility features and GitLab support) remain unimplemented. The scope of the *Must Have* features alone—particularly ensuring compatibility with Jupyter Book 1.x, Sphinx conventions, and client-side operations—consumed the majority of available time. Future iterations could address these enhancements, building on the modular architecture.

The implementation status of all requirements can be found in [Appendix A](../appendices/a.md)
